# **What I do outside of work**

Like many other teenagers of the 2000s, I was deeply interested in video games, trading cards, computers, the internet, and, of course, television and movies. Today, these interests, especially those concerning computers, the internet, and video games, continue to be an part of my life. During my gaming sessions, I spent a lot of time on the internet, constantly experimenting with new things. It all started with creating a simple website. After that, I developed small programs and scripts that helped me with various tasks on my PC. With my entry into the world of software development, I found my passion as an iOS developer (obviously ðŸ˜‰).
### 
In addition to software development, I also have hobbies that I practice to varying degrees of proficiency, such as graphic design, creating 3D models for my 3D printer, baking muffins and cakes, playing Yo-Yo, and binge-watching every single episode of Doctor Who. Outside my four walls, I enjoy going bouldering with friends, occasionally strolling through flea markets, and taking beach walks in my hometown.

Furthermore, I've recently become fascinated about everything related to AI. In addition to experimenting with image generation, I plan to train my own LLM for a personal project, which can then be used as a chatbot in an app. Currently, I have several other small projects in the pipeline.
