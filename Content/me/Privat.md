# **What I do outside of work**

As a teenager, I was already passionate about things related to computers and the internet. It all started with creating a simple website. After that, I developed small programs and scripts that helped me with various tasks on my PC. With my entry into the world of software development, I found my passion as an iOS developer. ( obviously ;) )
### 
In addition to software development, I also have hobbies that I practice to varying degrees of proficiency, such as graphic design, creating 3D models for my 3D printer, play board games, baking muffins and cakes, playing Yo-Yo, and binge-watching every single episode of Doctor Who. Outside my four walls, I enjoy going bouldering with friends, occasionally strolling through flea markets, and taking beach walks in my hometown.
### 
Furthermore, I've recently become fascinated by everything related to AI. In addition to experimenting with image generation, I plan to train my own LLM for a personal project, which can then be used as a chatbot app. Currently, I have several other small projects in the pipeline.
