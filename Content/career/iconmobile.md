# **iconmobile**

### May 2014 - May 2020

During my time as a student worker and in a full-time role, I contributed to various projects and prototype developments, conducted thorough research on diverse topics, and engaged in comprehensive app benchmarking. While working on the development of new features across different projects, I began using **Swift from version 1.0** onward. I gained hands-on experience with various architectural paradigms, although most apps during that period primarily utilized either **MVC**, a customized MVC variant, or **MVVM**.
### 
The most significant milestone in my career at iconmobile was proving myself in the role of Lead in a client project, where, as a team, we successfully achieved our project goals.
### 
Some of the particularly exciting projects I had the opportunity to work on include:
- Oral-B versions 3.0 to 5.1
- Oral-B Smart Mirror Prototype
- We Park
- Henkel SalonLab
