# **Master of Science**

### March 2017

The focus of my master's thesis was on exploiting the error correction capabilities of QR codes. Leveraging the acquired knowledge, I developed a library for Android and iOS, enabling users to personalize the black modules of a QR code with their images. This involved intentionally introducing errors into the QR code to optimize the representation of the embedded image. I successfully completed my master's degree study at Beuth University of Applied Sciences in Berlin with an overall grade of "**very good**".
